# Hello!

The project architecture was based on what I got used to working on.

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Git hooks (husky, lint-staged)
- Jest
- React testing library
- Styled-components (theme provider)
- Plop
- Storybook
- styled-media-query (responsive purpose)

## Features

There are basically four features:
- List bottles
- Get information about the bottle
- Search by beer name
- Add new bottle
    - Save on the device through localStorage

Works perfectly on different device sizes.

Cheers! üçª
